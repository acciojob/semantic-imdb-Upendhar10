		<h2>Movie Summary</h2>
		During the British Raj in 1920, the tyrannical Governor Scott Buxton and his wife Catherine visit a forest in Adilabad, where they abduct Malli, an artistically talented young girl from the Gond tribe. The tribe's guardian Komaram Bheem embarks for Delhi to rescue her, disguising himself as a Muslim named Akhtar. 
		The Nizamate of Hyderabad warns Buxton's office of the impending danger and advises them to return the child. Undeterred, Catherine enlists Alluri Sitarama Raju, an ambitious Indian Imperial Police officer, to quell the threat, promising a promotion should he capture Bheem alive or a bounty otherwise. 
		Ram and his uncle Venkateswarulu attend a pro-independence gathering in disguise, where Bheem's aide Lachhu attempts to recruit them into Bheem's plot. 
		On the way to Bheem's hideout, Lachhu discerns Ram's identity and flees. Shortly afterward, Ram and Bheem witness a child getting trapped by a train wreck and work together to rescue him. 
		Unaware of their opposing allegiances, they form a close friendship.
